Hey! I'm Iv√°n Olivares Rojas. I formally started as a <del>webmaster</del> software developer back in 2006, working in PHP and HTML5 in that web 2.0 of the old times.

My main focus these days is operating reliable streaming services and lead teams around one of the biggest companies of media and entertainment: [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com), here I work as a Digital Operations Manager.

I love being part of communities and create new ones to learn and help others to start in technology, sometimes <a href="/articles">I'm writing some thoughs, ideas or just about tech</a> and <a href="/talks">sometimes I talk about that topics</a> too.

## More about me and history

I love to build things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2002, when I started to learn HTML & CSS together with PHP, using [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com) and [vBulletin](https://www.vbulletin.com) to <del>build</del> deconstruct forums and creates *dynamic Web 2.0 sites*. In 2006 I started building websites and software as a professional, so... officially I've been *building the web since 2006.*

Between 2015 and 2020, I worked as a Software Architect at [Globant](https://www.globant.com) for different projects/clients, where I had the opportunity to work with amazing people, designing software for big corporations in different industries such as marketing, e-commerce and airlines. In my career I've had the privilege of working at advertising agencies, start-ups, media and entertainment company and a consultant of professional services in technology.

I'm specialized in front-end / UI technologies, but in my background I have much experience working with platforms in high-concurrency of users consuming web services and APIs, even in streaming of audio and video.

My usual hobbies are enjoying [new adventures with Pompa üê∂ ](https://instagram.com/medicenpompa)  walking or traveling, taking new photos of buildings or people, and listening to podcast or music on Spotify and also in vinyl - [yes, you can get me one here](https://regalame.app/iolivares/vinilos). 

Finally, I'm always looking for opportunities to give back to communities that helped me become who I am today, through mentorships, open source, speaking at meetups/conference or organizing events to learn together and help new generations to learn about technology. When I don't have an *interesting side hustle* to be focused on, surely I'm thinking of how to contribute to this important purpose: teaching and helping others to grow. If you want to talk about this, [you can schedule a call here](https://calendly.com/iolivares/15min) and/or [invite me for coffee](https://www.paypal.me/ivanolivaresrojas/4).
