# About me

Hello! My name is Iv√°n Olivares Rojas and I love to build things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2002 when I started to learn HTML & CSS and PHP using PHPbb and vBulletin ~building~ deconstructing foros and "dynamic websites". On 2006 I start build web things as professional, so... officially I'm building the web since 2006.

Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege of working at advertising agencies, start-ups, a consultant of professional services in technology and a huge corporation. My main focus these days is operate reliable streaming services and manage teams around one of the biggest company of media and entertainment: WarnerMedia.

I work as a Digital Operations Manager at WarnerMedia. I previously worked as Software Architect at Globant for different projects/clients, where I had the opportunity to work with amazing people, designing software for big corporations in different industries such as marketing, e-commerce and airlines.

I'm specialized in front-end technologies, but In my background I have many experiences working with platforms with high-concurrency of users consuming web services and APIs, even in streaming of audio and video.

My usual hobbies are enjoy new adventures with [Pompa üê∂ ](https://instagram.com/medicenpompa) walking or traveling, take new photos from buildings or people and listen to music in [vinyl - yes, you can gift me one from this link -](https://regalame.app/iolivares/vinilos) or in Spotify -SpotifyNowPlaying Here- (like now I'm playing -song- | although I'm not playing anything right now).

Also, I'm always looking for opportunities to give back to communities that helped me become who I am today, through mentorship, open source, speaking on meetups/conferences or organizing events to learn together and help the new generations to learn about technology. When I don't have an interesting side hustle to be focused, sure I'm thinking how to help to this important purpose of my life: teach and helps others to growth. If you want to talk about this, [you can schedule a call here](https://calendly.com/iolivares/15min) or/and [invite me a coffee.](https://www.paypal.me/ivanolivaresrojas/4)

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind
- Node.js
