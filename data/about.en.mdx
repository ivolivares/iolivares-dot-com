# About me

Hello! My name is Iv√°n Olivares Rojas and I love to build things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2002 when I started to learn HTML & CSS and PHP using [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com) and [vBulletin](https://www.vbulletin.com), <del>building</del> deconstructing forums and creating *dynamic Web 2.0 sites*. In 2006 I started building websites and software as a professional, so... officially I've been building the web since 2006.

Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege of working at advertising agencies, start-ups, a consultant of professional services in technology and a huge corporation. My main focus these days is operating reliable streaming services and managing teams around one of the biggest companies of media and entertainment: [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com).

I work as a Digital Operations Manager at [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com). I previously worked as a Software Architect at [Globant](https://www.globant.com) for different projects/clients, where I had the opportunity to work with amazing people, designing software for big corporations in different industries such as marketing, e-commerce and airlines.

I'm specialized in front-end technologies, but in my background I have much experience working with platforms in high-concurrency of users consuming web services and APIs, even in streaming of audio and video.

My usual hobbies are enjoying [new adventures with Pompa üê∂ ](https://instagram.com/medicenpompa)  walking or traveling, taking new photos of buildings or people, and listening to music on [vinyl - yes, you can get me one here -](https://regalame.app/iolivares/vinilos) or on Spotify -SpotifyNowPlaying Here- (like now I'm playing -song- | although I'm not playing anything right now).

Also, I'm always looking for opportunities to give back to communities that helped me become who I am today, through mentorships, open source, speaking at meetups/conference or organizing events to learn together and help new generations to learn about technology. When I don't have an interesting side hustle to be focused on, surely I'm thinking of how to contribute to this important purpose: teaching and helping others to grow. If you want to talk about this, [you can schedule a call here](https://calendly.com/iolivares/15min) and/or [invite me for coffee](https://www.paypal.me/ivanolivaresrojas/4).

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind
- Node.js
- Vercel
