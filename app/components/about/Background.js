      <p>I have more than 6 years of work experience. In recent years I've worked with such technologies as: JavaScript, NodeJS, mobile development (native and hybrid for iOS), SQL and NoSQL databases and different JavaScript libraries and frameworks like: AngularJS, ReactJS, BackboneJS, ExpressJS, Restify, among others.</p>
      <p>Also, in the last few years I've worked with agile methodologies, proud of being part of <strong>excellence teams</strong> where I'm outstanding for my commitment, leadership, focus on objectives and global vision.</p>
      <p><strong>I like challenging myself all the time</strong>. Based on this, my career has been filled with different experiences in different industries: digital marketing, private and public events with high concurrency (online video and audio streaming) and recently the airline industry.</p>
      <p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably photographing some portraits or landscapes, <strong>thinking of some ideas</strong> to change the world, or crossing off another item from my bucket list.</p>
